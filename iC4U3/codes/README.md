# iC4U3 - Codes

## Project 1: iC4U Intelligent Ears

Description: One of the most common uses of intelligent disobedience occurs when they must cross the road. For example, IC4U first detects traffic lights. If the light is green, it starts processing the high-pitched sounds in its surroundings. Upon detecting, it identifies the source and then turns its head accordingly. In the event of a dangerous situation, it intelligently disobeys commands, even if the light remains green.

## Project 2: iC4U Object Information

Description: Mimicking the intelligent disobedience behavior required a more advanced level of object detection and data, such as the moving objects' speed, direction, and distance.

## Project 3: iC4U City Vision 

Description: It is the upgraded version of IC4Uâ€™s current city object detection. IC4U can not only detect traffic lights, stop signs, etc, but now IC4U can also detect and recognize the different colors of traffic lights.

## Project 4: iC4U Motion Detection

Description: IC4U3 can detect motion commands. For example, when the visually impaired person lifts their arm, IC4U sits.

## Project 5: IC4U Grocery Assistant

Description: iC4U now can help with shopping. A visually impaired person can show iC4U an item that they would like to buy. IC4U can tell them where to buy it, how much it costs, and if it is in stock by collecting data from various online retailers. I used web scraping.

## Project 6: iC4U Money Detection

Description: Another feature for shopping is for iC4U3 to be able to detect money and the value of the banknote.
